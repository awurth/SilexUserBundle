SilexUser adds support for a user system in Silex. It provides a flexible framework for user management that aims to handle common tasks such as user registration and authentication.

Features include:

- Users can be stored via Doctrine ORM or MongoDB ODM
- Registration support, with an optional confirmation per email
- Unit tested

Inspired by [FOS User Bundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle).
